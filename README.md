  ## Description [![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://lbesson.mit-license.org/)
  For this project we made a readme generator through Node.js. I actually used the app to make the README that you are currently looking at. You can see that it has multiple sections that I filled out using node prompts. It also contains a table of contents that you can click on to go to different sections. 

  ## Table of Contents

  ## Installation
  npm i

  ## Usage
  1. In your terminal cd into the Develop folder that contains the index.js file.
  2. Run the index file using node (node index.js)
  3. You will then answer a series of questions. These questions will make up your read me file so please read them carefully. If you make a mistake you can always edit it once the file is made.
  4. Once complete the readme file will be created inside of the Develop folder.
  5. Feel free to then move the read me file into your personal folder from there.

  ## Contributor Guidelines
  This is a private project for my UT Bootcamp class and I am tweaking it over time. Since it will be used in my portfolio I don't want any contributions.

  ## Tests 
  Since no one will be editing this there arent any test guidelines. I am just learning about testing so I am not 100% sure what to put in this section yet.
